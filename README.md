## Tideman
A ranked-choice system, voters can vote for more than one candidate. Instead of just voting for their top choice, they can rank the candidates in order of preference. 
  Here, each voter, in addition to specifying their first preference candidate, can also indicate their second and third choices. And what was supposed to be a tied election could now have a winner.
Ranked choice voting can also solve yet another potential drawback of plurality voting. 

Usage: `Usage: ./tideman [candidate names ...]` where candidates cannot be more than 9
